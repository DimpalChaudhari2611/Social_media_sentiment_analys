# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of social media data using data science techniques. It involves collecting data from various social media platforms, preprocessing the text, and applying machine learning models to analyze and classify sentiment.

## Key Features
- Data collection from multiple social media sources (Twitter, Reddit, etc.).
- Preprocessing steps like text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, LSTM).
- Evaluation metrics for model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualization of sentiment analysis results through graphs and charts.

## Installation
 Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare your social media dataset or use provided sample data.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and preprocess the text data.
3. Train and evaluate the sentiment analysis models using provided notebooks or scripts.
4. Visualize the results and analyze the sentiment distribution
