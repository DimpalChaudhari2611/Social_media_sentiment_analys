-- This could involve using SQL string manipulation functions depending on your database

-- Sentiment analysis might not be directly possible in SQL, but you can use sentiment scores from an external tool
-- Assuming sentiment scores are available in another table named 'sentiment_scores' with columns 'post_id' and 'score'
-- Join the sentiment scores to the processed data
